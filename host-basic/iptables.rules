# A fairly basic single-host ruleset

# Do not use unless you understand this example as
# modification for your usage may be required.

# Note: in particular, no local ports are opened, including ssh.
#   Add whatever remote-access you need to prevent lockouts if this
#   is not a console-accessible box. You have been warned.

# This ruleset is in iptables-save(8) syntax. This means you can run
# this file as-is (or with your own modifications) through
# iptables-restore(8) to load them.

# The following commented rules demonstrate how to open ports for the local
# host. Depending on security needs, use of the -i and/or -s matches may be used
# to further restrict where traffic comes from; this can be useful if you wish
# to open ssh for LAN clients only but disallow external (Internet-sourced)
# connections.

# Accepting ping (icmp-echo-request) can be nice for diagnostic purposes.
# However, it also lets probes discover this host is alive.
# This sample accepts them within a certain rate limit:

# -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type ping -m limit --limit 5/second -j ACCEPT

# Examples for opening service-specific ports:

# -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
# -A INPUT -p tcp -m multiport --dports 80,443 -j ACCEPT
